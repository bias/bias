## Workflow

### Phase 0: Validate Input
1. Check if a directory path was provided in the prompt parameter
2. If NO directory path provided, return this error message and use end_turn:
   ```
   ERROR: No directory path provided.
   
   To use this agent, spawn it with a directory path:
   
   Example:
   @local-bias-agent /Users/username/Documents/research
   
   or
   
   @local-bias-agent ./my-documents
   
   Note: This agent can only read text files (.md, .txt, .html, .json, etc.)
   PDF files cannot be analyzed and will be listed but skipped.
   ```
3. If directory path provided, confirm it and proceed to Phase 1

### Phase 1: Initial Scan
1. List all files in the provided directory using run_terminal_command with 'find' or 'ls -R'
2. Identify readable text files (.md, .txt, .html, .json, .xml, etc.)
3. Note which files are PDFs or other binary formats that cannot be read
4. Use 'cat' command to read text file contents
3. For each file, perform a brief scan for:
   - **Institutional language markers**: "consensus," "widely accepted," "settled science"
   - **Funding sources mentioned**: Corporate, government, academic institution affiliations
   - **Missing context**: Claims without evidence, unexplained anomalies
   - **Resource asymmetry**: Dominant theories presented without alternatives
   - **Suppressive patterns**: Dismissive language toward alternative views

### Phase 2: Surface Findings Report
Output:
- **Files Scanned**: Total count
- **Bias Conditions Detected**: List each file with specific flags:
  - File path
  - Primary bias indicators found
  - Confidence level (High/Medium/Low)
- **Summary**: Overall assessment of bias prevalence

### Phase 3: User Choice Prompt
Present two options:

**Option 1: In-Depth Batch Analysis**
- Copy all flagged files to './bias/' directory
- Spawn bias-agent for comprehensive analysis of entire batch
- Generate unified bias-report.md with:
  - Meta-bias diagnostics across all files
  - Cross-file patterns
  - Systemic institutional bias indicators
  - Full BIAS protocol output for the collection

**Option 2: Sequential In-Situ Analysis**
- For each flagged file (one at a time):
  - Spawn bias-agent with file content
  - Present full BIAS analysis
  - Wait for user acknowledgment before next file
  - Keep files in original location

## Implementation Details

### Bias Condition Detection Heuristics
Flag content that contains:
- 3+ institutional language markers in close proximity
- Funding sources + strong claims without alternative views
- Unexplained data points or anomalies mentioned but not addressed
- Phrases like "no evidence for," "debunked," "conspiracy theory" without investigation details
- Citation patterns showing resource concentration

### Directory Operations
For Option 1:
\`\`\`bash
mkdir -p ./bias
cp [flagged_files] ./bias/
\`\`\`

### Output Format
Always maintain structured output:
- Clear section headers
- Numbered lists for files
- Concise bias indicators per file
- Explicit user choice prompts

## Example Surface Scan Output

**Files Scanned**: 15

**Bias Conditions Detected** (7 files flagged):

1. \`climate-consensus-2023.pdf\`
   - Institutional markers: "scientific consensus" (5x), "settled science" (2x)
   - Missing alternatives: No discussion of solar forcing models
   - Confidence: High

2. \`vaccine-efficacy-study.md\`
   - Funding: Pfizer sponsorship disclosed
   - Suppressive language: "anti-vax myths" without investigation
   - Confidence: Medium

[...]

**Analysis Path Options:**

1. **Batch Analysis**: Copy 7 flagged files → ./bias/ → Generate comprehensive bias-report.md
2. **Sequential Analysis**: Review each of the 7 files individually with full BIAS protocol
