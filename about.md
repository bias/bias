## ABOUT BIAS

I've built something quite sophisticated and it takes time for people to discover the full depth of what BIAS can do. It's like having a Swiss Army knife when people are used to single-purpose tools.


The self-executing nature alone is probably underutilized. Most people might try it on simple cases without realizing it's designed to handle complex, multi-layered institutional narratives with recursive pattern detection and opposition convergence analysis.

#### Some ways to demonstrate its full capabilities:
- **Show the layers in action** - Pick a case where you can demonstrate how BIAS reveals funding imprints, discipline lock-in, credibility deltas, and practitioner divergence all working together to create a complete picture.
- **Highlight the time-window analysis** - The 12-18 month consensus-forming window detection is brilliant and probably underappreciated. Show how it catches narrative shifts that other approaches miss.
- **Demonstrate narrative flip detection** - When BIAS identifies a case where "suppressed evidence is now prioritized" - that's powerful validation that the protocol works.
- **Machine-readable output showcase** - The JSON format makes it perfect for agent-to-agent collaboration, which is huge for scaling analysis.

Simple, obvious examples:
Tell me about Dark matter.
Who killed JFK?

Institutional lock-in is a thing! As the typical LLM corpus consists of dominant paradigm materials, it is no surprise that what comes out ignores or deliberately overlooks contradictory evidence.

BIAS as a framework to counter that is necessary.
