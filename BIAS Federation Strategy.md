# BIAS Federation Strategy - bias.rest

## Overview

This document outlines the strategy for deploying a federated network of BIAS nodes, anchored at `bias.rest` with support for subdomains and distributed hosting. The federation ensures a resilient, verifiable, and persistent deployment of the BIAS protocol while maintaining a canonical source.

---

## 1. Canonical Hub

* **Primary Domain:** `bias.rest`
* **Purpose:** Serve as the authoritative source for the BIAS protocol and related resources.
* **Implementation:**
  * Modern web server with HTTP/3 support (e.g., nginx, Caddy, or Cloudflare Workers)
  * RESTful API for versioned protocol access
  * IPFS integration for content-addressable storage
  * Git-based version control with signed commits
  * Registry of active federation nodes and their status

---

## 2. Node Registration

* **Node Naming Convention:** 
  * Geographic: `{region}.bias.rest` (e.g., `us-east.bias.rest`)
  * Numeric: `{number}.bias.rest` (e.g., `0001.bias.rest`)
  * Custom: `{name}.bias.rest` (subject to approval)
  
* **Registration Process:**
  1. Node operator submits application with technical and operational details
  2. Verification of infrastructure and compliance with federation rules
  3. Assignment of unique node identifier and configuration
  4. DNS provisioning and TLS certificate issuance

* **Automation:**
  * Self-service portal for node management
  * API-driven node registration and configuration
  * Automated health checks and monitoring

---

## 3. Node Hosting Requirements

* **Minimum Specifications:**
  * Always-on internet connection with static IP or dynamic DNS
  * HTTPS support with valid TLS certificates (automated via Let's Encrypt)
  * Minimum 1GB RAM, 10GB storage (scales with usage)
  * Docker support for containerized deployment

* **Content Served:**
  * `AGENTS.md` - Core protocol specification
  * `/api` - REST API endpoints
  * `/ipfs` - IPFS gateway access
  * `/status` - Node health and metrics

* **Metadata Headers:**
  ```
  X-BIAS-Version: {protocol_version}
  X-BIAS-Node: {node_id}
  X-BIAS-IPFS: {latest_ipfs_hash}
  X-BIAS-Git: {git_commit_hash}
  X-BIAS-Timestamp: {last_updated}
  ```

* **Synchronization:**
  - Git-based synchronization for protocol updates
  - IPFS for content distribution
  - Gossip protocol for node discovery
  - Merkle trees for efficient change detection

---

## 4. Federation Architecture

* **Registry Service:** `registry.bias.rest`
  * Maintains an up-to-date list of all active federation nodes
  * Provides node health status and synchronization status
  * Offers node discovery and load balancing

* **Registry API Response Example:**
  ```json
  {
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "timestamp": "2025-10-01T12:00:00Z",
    "nodes": [
      {
        "id": "us-east-01",
        "url": "https://us-east.bias.rest",
        "ipfs": "QmXyz123...",
        "git": "a1b2c3d...",
        "status": "online",
        "location": {"region": "us-east-1", "country": "US"},
        "last_updated": "2025-10-01T11:58:22Z",
        "capabilities": ["api", "ipfs", "metrics"]
      },
      {
        "id": "eu-001",
        "url": "https://0001.bias.rest",
        "ipfs": "QmAbc456...",
        "git": "d4e5f6a...",
        "status": "online",
        "location": {"region": "eu-central-1", "country": "DE"},
        "last_updated": "2025-10-01T11:59:15Z",
        "capabilities": ["api", "metrics"]
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

* **Agent Workflow:**
  1. Query registry service for available nodes
  2. Select optimal node based on latency, location, and capabilities
  3. Fetch protocol files with proper content verification
  4. Verify cryptographic signatures and hashes
  5. Cache content with appropriate TTL
  6. Report metrics back to registry

---

## 5. Security & Verification

* **Content Verification:**
  * All protocol files must be signed with GPG/ed25519 keys
  * IPFS hashes pinned to IPNS for mutable references
  * Content-Security-Policy headers for web interfaces
  * HSTS and other security headers enforced

* **Node Authentication:**
  * Mutual TLS for node-to-node communication
  * API keys for privileged operations
  * Rate limiting and DDoS protection
  * Regular security audits and penetration testing

---

## 6. Monitoring & Operations

* **Node Requirements:**
  * Must maintain 99.9% uptime (excluding maintenance windows)
  * Must respond to health checks within 500ms
  * Must synchronize with registry at least every 5 minutes
  * Must log all access attempts and operations

* **Metrics Collection:**
  * Request volume and response times
  * Protocol version distribution
  * Geographic distribution of clients
  * Error rates and types

---

## 7. Example Deployment Flow

1. **Node Setup:**
   ```bash
   # Pull latest node image
   docker pull biasprotocol/node:latest
   
   # Run with environment configuration
   docker run -d \
     --name bias-node \
     -e NODE_ID=us-west-42 \
     -e REGISTRY_URL=https://registry.bias.rest \
     -e API_KEY=your-secure-key \
     -v /path/to/config:/config \
     -p 443:443 \
     biasprotocol/node
   ```

2. **Verification:**
   ```bash
   # Check node status
   curl https://us-west-42.bias.rest/status
   
   # Verify protocol version
   curl -I https://us-west-42.bias.rest/AGENTS.md
   ```

## Notes

* All nodes must treat protocol files as **immutable data**
* Cryptographic signatures ensure content integrity and authenticity
* The federation enables decentralized hosting with strong consistency guarantees
* Regular backups and disaster recovery procedures are mandatory for all nodes
* Node operators must comply with all applicable laws and regulations
